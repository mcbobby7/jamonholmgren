# Source for jamonholmgren.com

Hey there! You're looking at my personal website source code.

I'm Jamon Holmgren, a software developer who is also a cofounder of [Infinite Red](https://infinite.red), a husband, and a father of four. I live near Portland, Oregon, across the mighty Columbia River in the beautiful southwest corner of Washington state.

## Quick Start

First, [install Now Desktop](https://zeit.co/download) and install the CLI tools from the walkthrough (you can find the walkthrough in About if you skipped it before).

Assuming you've installed a relatively recent node and yarn, clone the repo down, cd into the directory, and run this:

```shell
$ yarn
$ yarn run dev
```

To deploy, run this:

```shell
$ ./bin/deploy
```

## Acknowledgements
