      <p>So, last year we installed an above-ground 18' pool.</p>
      <p>
        I had my brother-in-law flatten out an area 25' in diameter, though,
        because I figured if this experiment went well we might want to upgrade
        to a 24' sometime later when the pool needed to be replaced.

      <p>It was a saltwater pool and also had a sand filter.</p>
      <p>
        I struggled to keep the water from getting murky, because I was a pool
        newbie who doesn't read directions very well.
      </p>
      <p>(In the second photo, you can see the water is too green.)</p>

      <p>
        I finally figured that out partway through summer and we enjoyed the
        pool the rest of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        But then another rookie mistake: I entirely emptied my pool before
        winter, thinking that was the best thing to do.
      </p>
      <p>There was a windstorm in December and the pool collapsed.</p>
      <a
        href="/static/pool/image51.jpg"
        target="_blank"
        className="image-wrapper"
      >
        <img title="" src="/static/pool/image51.jpg" alt="" />
      </a>
      <p>So, off to the dump it went. Sad trombone.</p>
      <a
        href="/static/pool/image35.jpg"
        target="_blank"
        className="image-wrapper"
      >
        <img title="" src="/static/pool/image35.jpg" alt="" />
      </a>
      <p>So we debated building an in-ground pool, but two major objections:</p>
      <p>1.Cost &mdash; figure minimum $80,000, possibly more.</p>
      <p>
        2.Ground water &mdash; we are perilously close to the water table, and
        it didn't seem like a good idea to tempt fate by digging a huge hole.
      </p>
      <p>
        But then Chyra started researching above ground pool decks. And it
        started making sense to go that route.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her brother builds decks but is always super busy. But! He was waiting
        for a big project to start. We got lucky.
      </p>
      <p>
        Doing a full deck around the whole thing would be cool, but also pretty
        expensive ($30-40k by itself). Instead, we decided to build it halfway
        around the pool. This saved nearly half of that.
      </p>
      <p>
        So my other bro-in-law came back (it pays to have brothers-in-law in
        construction) and dug it out.
      </p>
      <p>
        We went down 18" into the soil to sink the pool down and keep the deck
        height from being too high off the ground, which would look strange.
      </p>
      <a
        href="/static/pool/image57.jpg"

        className="image-wrapper"
      >
        <img title="" src="/static/pool/image57.jpg" alt="" />
      </a>
      <p>Here's the end result.</p>

      </a>
      <p>
        So the new pool is a Saltwater 8000 from{" "}
        <a href="https://twitter.com/ThePoolFactory">@ThePoolFactory</a>. The
        truck came in, I backed my trailer up to it, and the driver dropped it
        right on the trailer.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's <strong>heavy</strong>.

      </a>
      <p>
        So I towed it out into the field, had my &ldquo;sand guy" deliver 10
        cubic yards of sand, and my deck-building bro-in-law started working on
        the deck foundation.

        He started with the posts and joists, which are made from pressure
        treated lumber.
      </p>
      <p>
        The outside posts are 6'-0" on center (183 cm in non-freedom-units). The
        inside is carefully measured off the centerpoint to follow outside the
        outer wall of the pool.
      </p>
      <p>He built it very rugged. This thing could support an elephant.</p>
      <p>
        (Some of the supports in these photos are temporary and will be cut and
        attached more permanently.)

      <p>
        One reason the joists are so close together is we went with this{" "}
        <a href="https://twitter.com/timbertechABP">@timbertechABP</a> Trex-like
        composite decking. It can't span quite as far, but it is super durable.

        We designed the deck to end at a right angle to the pool but it didn't
        feel right, so we extended it with these wings. (Chyra did a great job
        with design all the way through.)
      </p>
      <p>The decking went on steadily over the course of several days.</p>

        By the way, you can see the vineyard behind our house in the distance.
        It's a little overgrown, although I did see the neighbor working on it
        today, which is nice to see.

        With the decking done, Walt (BIL) cut the inner curve of the pool edge
        off the decking, and it started looking like a deck!

        I didn't get many in-progress photos of the stairway, but rest assured
        like the rest of the deck that it's well-built.

        This is a good time to note that the biggest clump of clover is right at
        the foot of the stairway. I think we'll need to do something about it. I
        hate to lose the flowers for the bees but can't have my barefoot kids
        getting stung.

        With the deck mostly done (railing and gate still to be done, as well as
        the skirting and some other odds and ends), it was time to level out the
        sand and get it up to grade. A screed board around a central point works
        well for this.

        Walt then added pavers where each pool post will go and leveled them.
        Everything he does is within fractions of an inch &mdash; a real
        craftsman. He also tamped down the sand to compact it.

        So I kept the pump and filter from the old pool. I was nervous that it
        wouldn't fit to the new pool's skimmer and outlet jet but it did. I was

        One intake needed to be capped off, so I had my dad 3D print me a new
        one. He's still pretty new to it so it took quite a few tries. In the
        end he bought a 1-1/4" PVC end cap and it fit perfectly, so I didn't get
        to use his 3D printed one. Oh well.

        Unfortunately, we had to stop because the instructions say that we need
        3" of sand in the bottom *inside* the pool wall (doesn't make sense to
        me). So I'm waiting for a load of sand Monday from my sand guy.
      </p>
      <p>I'll also call The Pool Factory and see if it's strictly necessary.</p>

        Sand guy was here this morning. I had him dump it in a more hidden area
        behind a bunch of young sequoias. Walt will bring a tractor here and use
        it to dump more sand in the pool bottom.

        Walt had called{" "}
        <a href="https://twitter.com/ThePoolFactory">@ThePoolFactory</a> but
        they said you absolutely need the 3" of sand in the bottom. Bummer; this
        isn't really a 54" pool then, if you lose 3" of the bottom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Walt using my father-in-law's old John Deere tractor to dump extra sand
        in the pool. Ced is waiting to spread it out.

        14,000 gallons will take 24-48 hours with a hose. It'll cost about $34

        So <a href="https://twitter.com/ThePoolFactory">@ThePoolFactory</a> said
        that we *had* to put the 3" of additional sand in the bottom, but based
        on how much liner overlap we have on the walls, we definitely could have
        done without that. (We already had 3" as a base.) We could have gotten
        2-3" of additional depth. 😒

        The project generates lots of cardboard boxes. I'm happy to have a
        lawnmower with a trailer so I can haul it to the street.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have a riding mower, I recommend getting one of these trailers. I
        use it all the time, for hauling dirt, bark dust, rock, packages, etc.

        Picking up salt ($14 for a 40 lb bag &mdash; need 9 of them) plus a bag
        of filter sand. The trailer hitch rack works well for this, although I
        put some of them inside the Wrangler.

        Pump set up. Waiting for water to get up to the intake so we can test

        had to do some modifications to get the pump to attach properly (it
        isn't for this pool) but no leaks that I can see!

        Trying not to fall in as I dump 40lb bags of salt in. Even with
        quick-dissolving pool salt it still settles on the bottom. I'll have to

        Just shut off the water. Just under 48 hours of filling to hit the level

        Salt level is 2045 PPM. We need to hit 3000-3200. The ocean is something
        like 30,000 PPM, so you won't really taste any salt in this water.

        Running the &ldquo;Boost" mode to blast the pool with chlorine since we

        Walt also built a step and secured the stairway to it. It's pretty solid
        now.

        Pool party happening now. The water is up to about 75 degrees. Still a
        bit cold but swimmable.

        Gate is on, skirting mostly done. It's about 76 degrees so it's way
        easier to swim in now.

        Everything is done and I get a rare moment with the pool to myself. 💜
