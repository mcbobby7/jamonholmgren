      <h2>Talks &mdash; Recent and Upcoming</h2>

      <p>
        I sometimes give talks at conferences (when I'm not{" "}
        <a href="https://infinite.red/ChainReactConf">helping organize one</a>)
        and meetups. I've added links to a few here and will try to keep it up
        to date. In the upcoming section, I've also added some other meetups and
        conferences I plan to attend even if I'm not speaking, in case you want
        to connect there.
      </p>
