      <p>
        When my dad brought home a 286 in 1991, I was enthralled. I watched as
        he painstakingly typed and simultaneously repeated{" "}
        <code>cd backslash games enter</code> and saw the screen scroll and
        change. It was mind-blowing to a ten year old.
      </p>

      <p>
        A couple years later, a middle school math teacher gave me a book on
        BASIC programming, and said she had noticed I liked computers. At home,
        I discovered that our new 486DX computer had QBasic. I was in heaven.
      </p>

      <p>
        That has led to a life-long obsession with coding. The journey has taken
        me from running large excavation equipment to framing houses to 3D CAD
        design, until I eventually landed on a career in software.
